# the Crafting doubles README

the purpose of this exercise is to focus on learning how to create and use doubles in RSpec tests. All the tasks and the challenge can be completed within the 'double_spec.rb' file in the 'spec' folder. Therefore, we don't need to don't need to create any additionaly Ruby files in the 'lib' folder.

We create and use doubles within the RSpec tests directly, without the external classes or methods.

## How to complete the task
1. Set up a blank double
2. Set up a double with methods
3. Set up a double with methods that take arguments
4. Set up a double that expect to be called
5. Create a double for a specific case
